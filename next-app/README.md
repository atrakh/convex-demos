This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```

After creating the project, convex-dev was installed:

```bash
npm install convex-dev.
```

Convex functions were added to the `convex/` directory and a provider was added
to `_app.tsx`.
